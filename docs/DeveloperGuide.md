## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Person` objects from the model.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `AddressBookParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the `Person` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find by relationship

The `find` command supports either name keywords or one relationship filter. `FindCommandParser` tokenizes the
`r/` prefix and delegates validation to `ParserUtil#parseRelationship(String)`. The parser accepts only `Client` or
`Prospect`, with case-insensitive matching provided by `Relationship#fromString(String)`.

For a relationship search, the parser creates a `RelationshipMatchesPredicate`. `FindCommand` passes this predicate
to `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)`, which updates the `FilteredList<Person>` observed by the UI.
Because filtering does not reorder the source list, matching persons appear in the same order as they do for the
`list` command.

Name searches continue to use `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. The two search forms are deliberately kept separate:
a command cannot combine name keywords with an `r/` filter.

### Dated interaction notes (US14)

`note INDEX d/yyyy-MM-dd n/NOTE` appends an interaction note to the person at the index in the currently displayed
list. It works for clients and prospects, preserves the current filter, and does not replace earlier entries.

#### Model and command flow

1. `AddressBookParser` routes the command to `NoteCommandParser`. The parser reads the index and date before `n/`,
   then treats the entire remaining body as text. URLs, slashes and further prefix-like strings remain note content.
2. `InteractionNote` stores an immutable `LocalDate` and nonblank text. Date parsing checks the `yyyy-MM-dd` shape
   and uses strict ISO calendar validation. Past dates are allowed. Surrounding text whitespace is stripped;
   internal content and case are preserved without a character whitelist or maximum length.
3. `NoteCommand` checks the displayed index, copies the selected person's history, appends the new entry and calls
   `Model#setPerson` with a replacement `Person`. Other fields remain unchanged. Same-date and identical entries
   are retained in insertion order.
4. The observable list updates the corresponding `PersonListViewCell`. `LogicManager` saves the address book through
   the existing storage pipeline and returns `Added interaction note for NAME.` on success.

`Person#getInteractionNotes()` exposes an immutable defensive copy. History participates in `Person` equality and
hashing, but not duplicate identity detection. Both `EditCommand` and `InfoCommand` carry the existing history into
their replacement persons. `PersonBuilder` also preserves it when copying a person.

#### Persistence and display

`JsonAdaptedPerson` stores an `interactionNotes` array of `JsonAdaptedInteractionNote` objects, each containing
`date` and `text`. Missing or null arrays in older JSON files become empty histories. Loading validates stored
dates and note text; serialization preserves entry order and duplicates.

`PersonCard` displays dated, wrapped labels in the existing card's interaction-note container. Empty histories are
hidden and unmanaged. Labels have a zero minimum/preferred width and an unbounded maximum width so the parent
provides their available width during measurement. Their preferred width must not be bound to the card's actual
width: a newly replaced card has not yet been laid out, and that binding causes an excessive first wrapped-height
measurement. No fixed card height or forced list refresh is needed.

#### Validation and scope

The parser distinguishes missing index, date and note prefix; malformed calendar dates and blank text have specific
errors. Execution rejects indices outside the currently displayed list before changing the model.

This feature provides adding and displaying dated notes only. Chronological sorting, note correction/removal,
structured interaction outcomes, follow-ups and note search remain separate user stories.

Automated and manual regression checks are described in the [Testing guide](Testing.md#us14-interaction-note-regression-checks).

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.
</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.
</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.
</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.
